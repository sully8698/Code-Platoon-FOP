There once was a newbie coder who was determined to get an assignment done, but was constantly disrupted! After several days of starting and stopping, this coder was resolved to dig in and finish the job. There seemed to be some good momentum building, until the phone rang. 

"Hey mom," came the sound of her adorable 20-year-old son. "Something happened to my car..."

An hour later, she's back to the assignment, although, writing stories isn't one of her favorite things to do. (Disrupted or distracted?) She reached out to her coding partner, asking for help. Maybe he can save the day!!!
